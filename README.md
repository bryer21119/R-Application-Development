# Overview

From this project in R, I was tryign to make a bank account application that shows an intial balance, the ability to withdraw money, the ability to add interest, and transfer money from one account to another.

The purpose of this application is imitate a bank account with several different methods that allow you to interact with a bank account.

My purpose and goal of the application is to show a bank account that can be use to transfer money, transfer interest, and show intial and available balances. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
